### Create Website hermetic.surge.sh

I developed a website in an initial version to explain the functioning and ecosystem of the network.

It also has an invitation to a community on Discord where everyone can discuss and be part of the evolution of HERM.

It was made in Svelte, with Svelekit.

The website is at: https://hermetic.surge.sh

This includes all pixel art.
