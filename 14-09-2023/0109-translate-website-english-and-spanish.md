### Translate Website English and Spanish

I created a basic translation structure and with the help of AI (for the translations) I created a translation file that included English and Spanish.

I'm no expert in these languages, so they definitely need to be reviewed, so it's worth taking into consideration that the implementation itself is more relevant in this specific analysis.

> I can share the profits if someone is willing to review the translation and correct the errors.
