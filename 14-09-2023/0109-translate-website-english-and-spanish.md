### Translate Website English and Spanish

I created a basic translation structure and with the help of AI (for the translations) I created a translation file that included English and Spanish.

I'm no expert in these languages, so they definitely need to be reviewed, so it's worth taking into consideration that the implementation itself is more relevant in this specific analysis.

> I can share the profits if someone is willing to review the translation and correct the errors.


#### Last News

I made new implementations 09/014/2023 2:58 and included two more languages, Mandarin and Arabic.

I also redesigned the language selection and created a dropdown with simple animation to support even more languages in the future.

I hope I can later document an easy way for anyone to contribute in this regard.

In addition to support for Arabic, which has a different standard, but was not as complex.

I hope I don't have any glaring errors.

As well as some other things, like changing the color to a more neutral one.
